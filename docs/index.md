## TEST TASK

It may take a full working day to complete this task, if you are not comfortable spending that much time, feel free to stop it and go out chilling...ðŸ˜‡ You will be using libraries/technologies that are used on our project and the task itself is very similar to what you'll be doing daily as a developer in our team.

> When you will commit the code, please make up meaningful descriptions to commits and also create at least one Pull Request with self-explained description. We want to make sure you have solid skills working with the version control system and you pay attention to how you explain what are your commits about.

- Create new project using Create React App, use **TypeScript** [template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)

- Add **react-query** to fetch/cache application data
- Add **graphql-request** to communicate with the server. GraphQL endpoint to consume - [https://test-task.expane.pro/api/graphql](https://test-task.expane.pro/api/graphql)(to get online API documentation open it in browser)
- Add **react-hook-form** to submit/validate forms
- Create a simple application that allows to view and edit the list of clients. Basically, it should consist of a table, modal add/edit dialog, and add button. Please make it as pretty and UX-friendly as you can - imagine Yourself as administrator who operate with clients 100 times a day.

> Make sure you use all **bolded** technologies mentioned before - we will evaluate how task is done using particular stack that we use in our product. And yeah, please don't use Redux, You don't need it, really...ðŸ¥´
